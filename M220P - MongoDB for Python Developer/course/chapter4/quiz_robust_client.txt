When our application is using a Write Concern more durable than w: 1.

The primary reason to use a wtimeout is because by default, when using Write Concern more durable than w: 1, there is no wtimeout, so the server will wait indefinitely for operations to complete.

Our application can use wtimeout to put a time limit on how long the server waits before a Write Concern is satisfied.

Incorrect answers:

When our application is using a Read Concern more durable than "available".
