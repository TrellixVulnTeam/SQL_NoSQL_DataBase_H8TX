Correct answers:

New operations can be serviced with pre-existing connections, so a new connection doesn't have to be created each time.

This is the main benefit from using a connection pool. The overhead of creating a TCP connection often results in waiting time, but this waiting time can be avoided by reusing a connection.

A large influx of operations can be handled more quickly with a pool of existing connections.

A common cause of application crashes is the inability of that application to deal with an influx of operations to perform. By creating a lot of available connections before they are needed, the application has the bandwidth to service as many requests as connections, without having to create any new connections.

Incorrect answers:

Multiple database clients can share a connection pool.

This is not true. Connection pools are specific to a database client, and the number of connections in the pool is declared when the client is initialized.

The connection pool will persist after the client is terminated.

This is not true. All the connections in the pool are dropped when the client object is terminated.
